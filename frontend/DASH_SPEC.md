Stepowoy Enterprises — Contractor Performance Dashboard (Mockup)

Purpose: Present a polished, executive-ready demo that shows how SBE training engagement connects to job performance and revenue outcomes for Stepowoy Enterprises.

1) Who this is for

· Primary: Stepowoy leadership (Owner/GM), Ops/Service Managers.

· Secondary: Team Leads/Trainers; Finance for variance checks.

2) Objectives (what success looks like)

1. Convey, at a glance, overall health of revenue, sales execution, and training engagement.

2. Make the relationship between training and job performance self-evident.

3. Provide three intuitive drill-ins that answer the next obvious questions.

4. Feel “boardroom ready”: clean, modern, branded, credible.

3) Scope (this mockup only)

· One dashboard screen with top KPIs and five visual panels.

· Three drill-ins (details below).

· Mock data only; include timestamp label: “Updated Hourly (demo).”

· No integrations, auth, or exports in this phase (optional add-ons later).

4) Key KPIs (top cards)

1. Revenue (MTD) – Total closed/won revenue month-to-date vs. goal (progress).

2. Close Rate (%) – Closed/won ÷ qualified opportunities; show peer benchmark.

3. Average Ticket ($) – Avg revenue per closed job; show target band.

4. Active Learners (count) – Unique users in training/coaching last 30 days; show Engagement Index.

Notes: Each KPI has a short tooltip (plain English definition and data source label). All values are simulated but realistic.

5) Dashboard layout (single screen)

· Header: SBE + Stepowoy logo marks, title, “Updated Hourly (demo)” timestamp, Light/Dark switch.

· Filters: Contractor (fixed to Stepowoy), Time Range (MTD/QTD/YTD), Rep (All + list).

· KPI Row: 4 cards as above.

· Five Panels:

1. Training Attendance: Weekly bars by type (Recurring / One-Off / Coaching). Purpose: show participation trend.

2. Engagement Heatmap: Day × time-block grid highlighting peak engagement windows.

3. Job Performance: Line chart of Team Revenue vs. Goal; rep mini-tiles (Jobs, Close %, Avg Ticket, Revenue).

4. Training Performance: Three gauges (Quiz Pass, Certification Progress, Post-Training Rating), plus mini chart linking training outcomes to job metrics.

5. Financial Validation: CRM vs. QuickBooks monthly totals, variance %, status (green if within tolerance, amber if not).

· Executive Caption (footer): “With SBE’s integrated performance insight, Stepowoy leaders can finally see how training drives real results—from the classroom to the job site to the P&L.”

6) Interactions (high level)

· Filters update visible numbers/charts in place (mock behavior).

· Each of the three panels below includes a “View details →” link to a drill-in:

o Training Attendance (Panel 1)

o Job Performance (Panel 3)

o Financial Validation (Panel 5)

· Hover tooltips on KPIs and charts; badges for top performers.

7) The three drill-ins (business view)

A) Training Attendance — Detail

Question answered: Who is showing up to which training, and when are engagement windows strongest? Content:

· Trend by week, split by session type (Recurring / One-Off / Coaching).

· Heatmap: Weekday × time-block intensity.

· Top sessions table: Session, Type, Date, Attendees, No-Show % (mock). Outcome: Identify best scheduling windows and sessions that correlate with better field performance.

B) Job Performance — Rep Focus

Question answered: Which reps are driving results and where can coaching improve outcomes? Content:

· Rep selector (Ava, Noah, Marcus, Sophie, Liam).

· KPIs for selected rep: Jobs, Close %, Avg Ticket, Revenue MTD.

· Revenue vs. Goal trend (recent months).

· Funnel bars by stage (Lead → Qualified → Quoted → Won) and top job categories. Outcome: Targeted coaching and recognition; connect training completion to improved close rate and ticket size.

C) Financial Validation — Reconciliation

Question answered: Are CRM revenue figures aligned with QuickBooks, and where are discrepancies? Content:

· Month selector; tolerance selector (e.g., 2% default).

· Side-by-side totals (CRM vs. QB) for selected month.

· Variance % trend (last 6–12 months).

· “Suspect items” table (mock) with reasons (Missing invoice, Duplicate, Timing).

· Status: In Sync (green) or Variance Flag (amber). Outcome: Build executive trust; show that finance and ops numbers line up (or are flagged for review).

8) Data & definitions (business level)

· Data style: Realistic mock numbers (e.g., MTD revenue in hundreds of thousands; close rate 45–60%; avg ticket $600–$800; active learners 30–60).

· Time frames: MTD, QTD, YTD; "Last Updated" label shows current date/time (demo).

· Tolerance: Variance status turns amber when absolute variance % ≥ selected tolerance (business default 2%).

· Engagement Index: Composite (attendance recency, session variety, completion). Show as a single number in KPI and as progress bars in rankings.

9) Roles & visibility (mockup stance)

· Owner/Manager view implied (sees all reps).

· Rep view conceptually supported (Rep filter limits views).

· No authentication in the mock; keep it business-true in labels and copy.

10) Branding & look/feel

· Style: Clean, SBE-branded, generous whitespace, subtle gradients, soft corners, modern icons.

· Color cues:

o Primary accents: Indigo/Teal/Green (trust, growth).

o Status: Amber for warnings, Green for “in sync/on target.”

· Copy tone: Plain-English, decision-oriented (“Revenue vs Goal”, “Variance Flag”, “View details →”).

11) Acceptance criteria (business)

· The main screen clearly communicates current performance at a glance (four KPIs + five panels).

· The three “View details →” links open drill-ins that directly answer the next logical questions.

· Tooltips define each KPI in business terms.

· A variance status is visible and interpretable by finance and leadership.

· The executive caption reads as a concise value proposition.

· Everything on screen looks ready for an executive demo (no placeholder lorem; realistic numbers; consistent labels).
